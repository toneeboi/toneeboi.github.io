            It is a well-known and accepted fact that deforestation can lead to
            flooding. This phenomenon is exacerbated when the water flows
            through a steep slope which may bring with it debris such as tree
            branches, garbage, and mud, exacerbating the effects of floods.
            <br /><br />
            Unfortunately, policymakers firstly, have considered this event of
            flooding as isolated and thus are not pressed for creating policies
            in order to prevent this economic and life-threatening phenomenon.
            However, should a case be made for any action, leaders need to be
            guided on how to act.

            In this study, we use the <span class="emphasize">DeepLabV3+</span>.
            DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning model for semantic image
            segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels to every
            pixel in the input image. Deep lab was developed by Google Research
            and at the core of all its versions v1, v2, v3, and now v3+ is the
            <span class="emphasize">Atrous Convolution</span>. Atrous
            Convolution can keep the stride constant but with larger
            field-of-view without increasing the number of parameters or the
            amount of computation. This is especially significant in the study
            that I want to do given that the land area can be varied as well as
            the height of the image from the ground. So, we want to be able to
            take those factors into consideration. And finally, we can have
            larger output feature map which is good for semantic segmentation.
            What is new with the v3+ is the Encoder-Decoder Architecture. The
            <span class="emphasize">Decoder module</span> refines the
            segmentation results especially along object boundaries.
            Furthermore, in this encoder-decoder structure one can arbitrarily
            control the resolution of extracted encoder features by atrous
            convolution to trade-off precision and runtime. <br /><br />

            The training dataset was obtained from the application of the
            DeepLabV3+ by Ashwath, Balraj.3 It comprises of 723 RGB satellite
            images for training and 80 for validation along with their
            corresponding ground truth masks.

            As we can see from the image above, the model was able to correctly
            identify most areas as agricultural land. It was also able to
            correctly identify a considerable amount of the houses and roads as
            urban, as well as certain ponds as water. Moreover, the model was
            also able to identify empty lots as barren areas. And while we have
            thick and closely planted trees especially on the lower-right of the
            image, it still classified this as agricultural land. Interestingly,
            the model identified rice paddies as water as well. Given that the
            result is just a stitch of the resulting masks, it is noticeable
            that while there are some areas that are connected across each
            square image, it is also patchy such that unnatural line end for
            each square image.

            When it comes to the model, we can easily conclude that its analysis
            is dependent on the image being fed, thus we can a patchy area.
            <br /><br />
            With regard to our initial goal of aiding policymakers in creating
            plans in order to prevent a repetition of the flooding in the
            future, we can clearly see that there are no forested areas that can
            hold the water when it falls on the higher elevations. Furthermore,
            rice paddies which are sensitive to the amount of water being fed to
            it at the right time during planting season are located on the lower
            elevations and are thus susceptible to damage from the water coming
            from the high areas. The agricultural areas on the slopes are not
            protected from flooding either.
            <br /><br />
            Aside from the agricultural impact of land use, policymakers should
            also consider the residents of the area and their safety during
            natural disasters.
