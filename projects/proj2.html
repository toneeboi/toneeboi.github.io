            At the start of the processing of planters’ sugar cane, samples are
            taken to a laboratory where analysis is done. From this analysis,
            the planters will get what’s called a pesada. Although it varies
            between mills, a bare information can be found, including the output
            of the milling, that is the LkgTC or 50 kg bags per ton of cane
            milled. This is what's included in the dataset. Many industry
            theories revolve around the processing of sugar canes. This starts
            from planting all the way to producing the raw sugar from milling.
            Some of these theories include how more cane brought to the mill can
            help increase recovery as only a small amount of suface area is
            exposed to the air from harvest to milling such that only a small
            amount of juice is lost to evaporation or consumption of bacteria;
            or that the more trash the cane has, the lower quality it will
            produce. <br /><br />
            Apart from dispelling myths about what factors go into the
            production of sugar, this study identified the important measures
            available to planters can help predict the quality or amount of
            recovery of sugar from their canes.

            The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from a sugar mill in
            Negros. Only data from the year 2019 was used. The following are the
            variables found in the dataset along with their descriptions:<br /><br />
            <img
              src="/assets/images/proj2/definitions.png"
              alt=""
              class="contImg"
            /><br /><br />
            The LkgTC was binned into recovery classes 1 to 4 which reflects the
            desired (or undesired) range of output by both the mill and
            planters. <br /><br />
            <ol type="1">
              <li>1 — Failure</li>
              <li>
                2 — Acceptable for planters but mills will compensate with their
                35%
              </li>
              <li>3 — Acceptable for both mills and planters</li>
              <li>4 — Excellent recovery</li>
            </ol>
            <br />

            The following pairplot shows that some features are overlapping
            however there is a certain axis at which the recovery classes are
            well-delineated. <br /><br />
            <img
              src="/assets/images/proj2/pairplot.png"
              alt=""
              class="contImg"
            />
            <br /><br />
            Given the high imbalance of the distribution of recovery classes,
            resampling is performed. Resampling is done instead of assigning new
            albeit arbitrary values to bins in order to reflect the desireablity
            of the sugar recovery from the perspective of both planters and
            mill.

            The results from running multiple models of kNN Classifier, Linear
            SVC, C-Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, and Gradient
            Boosting Classfier above show that
            <span class="emphasize">Gradient Boosting Classifier</span> was the
            best model for the this dataset with a train score of 100%, and
            <span class="emphasize"></span> validation and test scores of more
            than 98%. This is markedly higher than the PCC score of the
            unsampled dataset above of 56.94%. However, to give us an idea of
            the decision trees that this model might produce, we tried to
            visualize the decision tree below. And with a max_depth of 5 or
            more, leaves already begin to overfit with single samples. Thus, we
            choose a <span class="emphasize">max depth = 4</span> which gives a
            validation score comparable to higher max_depths. The performance of
            this parameter is validated by the confusion matrix below.

            Based on the feature importances,
            <span class="strong">polarization</span> and
            <span class="strong">brix</span> appear to contribute the most to
            the machine learning model. As much as these are properties of the
            sugar juices, these are measures that can be obtained at any point
            in the process: from planting, to lab evaluation, and mid-milling.
            Moreover, the <span class="strong">week number</span> might be
            revisited with a data that spans more milling seasons in order to
            verify whether there is a contribution when the sugar canes are
            actually milled within each milling season.

            For planters, given that metrics such as polarization and brix can
            be acquired even from sugar canes before they are harvested and that
            a considerable amount of cost in sugar planting happens during
            harvest, we can evaluate the yield and whether they will be
            profitable or not before they actually put the money to costs.
            <br /><br />
            For mills, since we have a baseline that lab data can clearly
            predict the output. We can use this to check whether they are
            operationally efficient if they produce the expected output.
            <br /><br />
            For traders, they can check on the ground the performance of the
            sugar canes and foresee if they will get their desired and
            forecasted volume of supply for the milling season.
